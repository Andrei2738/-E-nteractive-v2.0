**Welcome to our game for preschool KIDS aged 5-7!**

**E-nteractive** is designed to be fun and educational for kids who are just beginning to explore the world around them. It is important to introduce our young learners to basic concepts such as geometry, recycling, being a good citizen and recognizing natural phenomena in a playful way. Our game is designed to be intuitive so that kids don't have to rely on reading or writing skills to move across the levels.

Each level corresponds to a preschool subject, such as basic geometry, how to recycle, how to be a good citizen or recognise natural phenomena. This game encourages kids to learn more about their surroundings and become socially aware. For example, by playing **E-nteractive**, kids learn how to identify different shapes, how to sort recyclable items, how to be kind to their peers and how to recognize animals and plants in their environment.

We believe that **E-nteractive** helps to foster a love for learning and exploration in our young learners. We hope that this game will help kids to develop important skills that will benefit them in school and beyond. We also believe that by playing **E-nteractive**, kids can become more engaged in their environment and become more socially aware of the world around them.
